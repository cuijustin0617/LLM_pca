h-Appendix: Database Descriptions
Environmental Risk Information Services (ERIS) can search the following databases. The extent of historical information varies with 
each database and current information is determined by what is publicly available to ERIS at the time of update. Note: Databases 
denoted with " * " indicates that the database will no longer be updated. See the individual database description for more information.
Abandoned Aggregate Inventory:
Provincial
rr-AAGR-bb
The MAAP Program maintains a database of abandoned pits and quarries.  Please note that the database is only referenced by lot and concession and 
city/town location.  The database provides information regarding the location, type, size, land use, status and general comments.*
Government Publication Date: Sept 2002* 
Aggregate Inventory:
Provincial
rr-AGR-bb
The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources maintains a database of all active pits and quarries.  The database provides information regarding the 
registered owner/operator, location name, operation type, approval type, and maximum annual tonnage.
Government Publication Date: Up to Sep 2016 
Abandoned Mine Information System:
Provincial
rr-AMIS-bb
The Abandoned Mines Information System contains data on known abandoned and inactive mines located on both Crown and privately held lands.  The

Anderson's Waste Disposal Sites:
Private
rr-ANDR-bb
The information provided in this database was collected by examining various historical documents which aimed to characterize the likely position of 
former waste disposal sites from 1860 to present.  The research initiative behind the creation of this database was to identify those sites that are missing
from the Ontario MOE Waste Disposal Site Inventory, as well as to provide revisions and corrections to the positions and descriptions of sites currently 
listed in the MOE inventory.  In addition to historic waste disposal facilities, the database also identifies certain auto wreckers and scrap yards that have 
been extrapolated from documentary sources.  Please note that the data is not warranted to be complete, exhaustive or authoritative.  The information 
was collected for research purposes only.
Government Publication Date: 1860s-Present 
Automobile Wrecking & Supplies:

many sources such as the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) boreholes from engineering reports and projects from the 1950 to 1990's in Southern 
Ontario.  Boreholes from the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) including The Urban Geology Analysis Information System (UGAIS) and the York Peel 
Durham Toronto (YPDT) database of the Conservation Authority Moraine Coalition.  This database will include fields such as location, stratigraphy, 
depth, elevation, year drilled, etc. For all water well data or oil and gas well data for Ontario please refer to WWIS and OOGW.
