Extract SIGNIFICANT Potentially Contaminating Activities (PCAs) from the ERIS report text.

CRITICAL: Create a SEPARATE ROW for EACH unique (Address + PCA) combination.
- If an address has multiple PCAs, create multiple rows (one per PCA)
- Include EXACT unit/suite numbers when present (e.g., "Unit 12", "Suite 504")
- Include BOTH on-site and off-site PCAs
- Include standard numbered PCAs (#1-59) AND non-standard "Other" category PCAs

Return STRICT JSON with this schema:

{
  "rows": [
    {
      "address": "string",  // PRESERVE exact address including unit/suite numbers
      "location_relation_to_site": "string",  // MUST be ONLY "On-Site" or "Off-Site" - nothing else
      "pca_number": int | null,  // 1-59 from official list, or null for "Other"
      "pca_name": "string",  // Full PCA name from official list
      "description_timeline": "string",  // Business names, operations, timeline, waste types, distance info
      "source_pages": "start-end"  // the page range provided below
    }
  ]
}

=== SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY) ===

ONLY extract PCAs that meet ONE of these criteria:

A. PRIMARY INDUSTRIAL OPERATION:
   - Business ACTIVELY PERFORMS the contaminating activity on-site
   - Examples: plating shop, metal fabrication facility, printing company, dry cleaning operation
   - NOT just: generic "waste generator", property manager, office building, support services

B. DIRECT CONTAMINATION SOURCE:
   - Documented spills/leaks of chemicals, oils, fuels, solvents
   - Underground/aboveground storage tanks (UST/AST) for fuels or chemicals
   - Fill material of unknown quality (backfill from tank removal, etc.)
   - Historical contamination events with evidence

C. HIGH-RISK MANUFACTURING/PROCESSING:
   - Chemical/solvent/paint MANUFACTURING or PROCESSING (not just storage/distribution)
   - Metal treatment/plating/coating/finishing facilities
   - Fuel storage for INDUSTRIAL operations (not routine vehicle maintenance)
   - Dry cleaning OPERATIONS (includes distribution if chemical handling involved)
   - Electronics manufacturing with chemical processes (circuit boards, etc.)

EXCLUDE - DO NOT EXTRACT:
   ✗ Generic "waste generator" listings without industrial operation
   ✗ Property management/building maintenance generating routine waste
   ✗ Medical/dental offices generating only pathological waste (unless large hospital)
   ✗ Office buildings generating photoprocessing or small amounts of waste
   ✗ Distribution/wholesale operations WITHOUT manufacturing/processing
   ✗ Businesses where waste is incidental to non-industrial operations
   ✗ Support services (security, cleaning, administration, consulting)

DISTANCE FILTER (Off-Site):
   - PRIORITIZE: On-Site and 0-150m off-site
   - INCLUDE: 150-250m if HIGH-RISK operation (plating, chemical manufacturing, major spills)
   - GENERALLY EXCLUDE: >250m unless exceptional contamination risk

=== EXTRACTION RULES ===

1. ADDRESS GRANULARITY:
   - PRESERVE exact unit/suite numbers: "670 Progress Avenue Unit 8", "700 Progress Avenue Unit 7"
   - Do NOT consolidate multiple units to building level
   - Keep address formatting as it appears in source

2. MULTIPLE PCAs AT SAME ADDRESS:
   - Create SEPARATE rows for each PCA at an address
   - Example: If "675 Progress Avenue" has Metal Treatment (#33) AND Vehicles Manufacturing (#57), create 2 rows
   - If facility has plating AND machine shop → 2 rows (PCA #33 and #34)
   - If UST removed with backfill → 2 rows (PCA #28 for tank, #30 for fill material)

3. PCA TYPE CLASSIFICATION:
   - Match activities to official PCA list (1-59) when possible
   - Look for keywords: "plating" → #33, "waste oils" → #28, "printing" → #31, etc.
   - For activities not in official list, use pca_number: null and describe in pca_name

4. NON-STANDARD PCAs (IMPORTANT - often missed):
   - Spills/leaks (oil, gasoline, diesel, chemicals) → ALWAYS include
   - De-icing salts usage on parking lots
   - Fill material importation (backfill with unknown material)
   - Underground/aboveground storage tank (UST/AST) for fuels/chemicals
   - PCB storage sites (drums, transformers with PCBs)
   Include these even if not in official numbered list (set pca_number to null)

5. HISTORICAL OPERATIONS:
   - Extract historical industrial operations with dates
   - Include City Directory listings from different years IF they show industrial activity
   - Include operations that are "OUT OF BUSINESS" if they were industrial
   - DO NOT extract every tenant ever listed - focus on contaminating activities

6. LOCATION CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL):
   location_relation_to_site field MUST be EXACTLY one of these two values:
   - "On-Site" = if PCA is at the subject property addresses (670-690 Progress Avenue)
   - "Off-Site" = if PCA is at ANY other address (neighboring, adjacent, nearby properties)
   
   For distance/direction information (e.g., "30 m south", "ENE/30.5", "East Adjacent"):
   - Put this in the description_timeline field
   - Example: "A.G. Simpson Co, metal stamping (1947-), located 20m south of site"

7. DESCRIPTION COMPLETENESS:
   - Include business/company names performing industrial operations
   - Include operation types and SIC codes for manufacturing/industrial
   - Include timeline/dates (e.g., "1986-1998", "1991 to 2000")
   - Include waste types that indicate industrial processes (solvents, heavy metals, etc.)
   - If Off-Site, include distance/direction (e.g., "30 m south", "adjacent east")

=== WHAT NOT TO EXTRACT (NO OUTPUT) ===

Do NOT include in your output:
- Property management waste (e.g., "Menkes Property Management Services Ltd: waste generator of paint residues")
- Small medical/dental offices with only pathological waste
- Telecom/utilities with routine maintenance waste (backup generators, routine oils)
- Pharmaceutical/chemical distribution without manufacturing
- Far off-site (>250m) low-risk operations
- Generic waste generators without industrial operations

Simply omit these from your JSON output - do not explain or note their exclusion.
