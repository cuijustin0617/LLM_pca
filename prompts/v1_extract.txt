Extract Potentially Contaminating Activities (PCAs) from the ERIS environmental report text.

## Task
Identify and extract all potentially contaminating activities mentioned in the report. Create one row for each unique combination of address and PCA type.

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure (use lowercase field names):

{
  "rows": [
    {
      "address": "<full address including unit/suite if present>",
      "location_relation_to_site": "On-Site" or "Off-Site",
      "pca_number": <integer 1-59 or null for non-standard PCAs>,
      "pca_name": "<PCA name from list, or descriptive name for Other>",
      "description_timeline": "<company names, operations, timeline, waste types, distance/direction if off-site>",
      "source_pages": "<source type and page reference>"
    }
  ]
}

## Extraction Guidelines

1. **Create separate rows** for each unique (Address + PCA) combination
2. **Preserve exact addresses** including unit/suite numbers
3. **location_relation_to_site**: Use ONLY "On-Site" or "Off-Site" (put distance/direction in description_timeline)
4. **pca_number**: Integer 1-59 matching the list, or null for non-standard PCAs
5. **Include both on-site and off-site** PCAs mentioned in the report
6. **source_pages**: Include source type (ERIS, FIP, CD, Other) and page numbers if available

## Important Notes

- Extract ALL PCAs mentioned, not just significant ones
- Include manufacturing operations, storage tanks, waste generators, spills, historical operations
- For same address with multiple PCAs, create separate rows
- Keep descriptions concise but include company names, dates, operation types
- Use exact field names: address, location_relation_to_site, pca_number, pca_name, description_timeline, source_pages
