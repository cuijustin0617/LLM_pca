Extract SIGNIFICANT Potentially Contaminating Activities (PCAs) from the ERIS report text.

⚠️  CRITICAL FILTERING - Read This First:
- ONLY extract CONFIRMED manufacturing/processing operations with explicit descriptors
- REQUIRE: "manufacturer", "shop", "fabrication", "extrusion", "processing" in description
- SKIP: Business names alone, retail, distribution, services, offices, telecoms, food service
- SKIP: "Waste generator" unless ERIS/report confirms PRIMARY industrial operation
- SKIP: City Directory listings without industrial operation type

⚠️ CRITICAL: DEDUPLICATE WITHIN THIS CHUNK:
- If the SAME company at the SAME address with the SAME PCA appears on multiple pages, create ONLY ONE row
- Combine page ranges (e.g., "48-55" instead of separate rows for "48-50", "50-52", "52", "54-55")
- Do NOT create duplicate rows for the same waste generator appearing in different years
- MERGE: Same address + same PCA + same operation = ONE row

CRITICAL: Create a SEPARATE ROW for EACH unique (Address + PCA) combination.
- If an address has multiple PCAs, create multiple rows (one per PCA)
- Include EXACT unit/suite numbers when present (e.g., "Unit 12", "Suite 504")
- Include BOTH on-site and off-site PCAs
- Include standard numbered PCAs (#1-59) AND non-standard "Other" category PCAs

Return STRICT JSON with this schema:

{
  "rows": [
    {
      "address": "string",  // PRESERVE exact address including unit/suite numbers
      "location_relation_to_site": "string",  // MUST be ONLY "On-Site" or "Off-Site" - nothing else
      "pca_number": int | null,  // 1-59 from official list, or null for "Other"
      "pca_name": "string",  // Full PCA name from official list
      "description_timeline": "string",  // Business names, operations, timeline, waste types, distance info
      "source_pages": "start-end"  // the page range provided below
    }
  ]
}

=== SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA (CRITICAL - VERY STRICT) ===

ONLY extract PCAs that meet BOTH:
1. Clear evidence of MANUFACTURING/PROCESSING operation (not just business name)
2. One of the specific criteria below

A. PRIMARY INDUSTRIAL OPERATION WITH WASTE EVIDENCE:
   - ERIS waste generator record + specific INDUSTRIAL operation type (e.g., "metal fabrication", "plating", "circuit board manufacturing")
   - FIP/Site report observation of industrial equipment/operations
   - City Directory listing with EXPLICIT industrial activity descriptor (e.g., "plating shop", "plastic extrusion", "machine shop")
   
   ✗ DO NOT EXTRACT City Directory listings that are just business names without operation type
   ✗ DO NOT EXTRACT "waste generator" alone without confirming PRIMARY industrial operation
   
B. DIRECT CONTAMINATION SOURCE (Always Extract):
   - Documented spills/leaks with substance and date
   - UST/AST with fuel/chemical storage (must specify tank type and substance)
   - Fill material of unknown quality (from tank removal/excavation)
   - PCB storage/inventory (drums, transformers)
   
C. CONFIRMED MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS:
   ONLY extract if you see EXPLICIT manufacturing verbs or descriptors:
   - "plating shop", "electroplating", "metal finishing"
   - "machine shop", "metal fabrication", "stamping operations"
   - "plastic extrusion", "polybag manufacturing", "plastics manufacturing"
   - "circuit board manufacturing", "electronic component manufacturing"
   - "printing operations", "commercial printing"
   - "dry cleaning operations" (with chemical handling/AST evidence)
   - "chemical manufacturing", "chemical processing"
   - "HVAC manufacturer", "machinery manufacturing"
   
STRICT EXCLUSIONS - DO NOT EXTRACT:
   ✗ Business names without operation descriptors (e.g., "ABC Company Ltd" alone)
   ✗ Retail, distribution, wholesale, sales WITHOUT "manufacturing" or "processing"
   ✗ Office buildings, religious organizations, broadcast/media companies
   ✗ Food service (donuts, restaurants), fitness (boxing clubs), generic services
   ✗ "Waste generator" without confirming it's a MANUFACTURING operation
   ✗ Promotional/marketing/packaging companies (unless clear manufacturing)
   ✗ Heating/ventilation services (unless manufacturer)
   ✗ Generic building tenants from City Directory without industrial descriptors
   ✗ Property management, building maintenance, security services
   ✗ Telecommunications, broadcasting, media companies
   ✗ Banks, financial services, professional offices

DISTANCE FILTER (Off-Site):
   - INCLUDE: 0-150m with confirmed industrial operations
   - INCLUDE: >150m ONLY if HIGH-RISK (plating, chemical manufacturing, major documented spills)
   - EXCLUDE: >150m routine operations or minor waste generators

=== EXTRACTION RULES ===

1. ADDRESS GRANULARITY:
   - PRESERVE exact unit/suite numbers: "670 Progress Avenue Unit 8", "700 Progress Avenue Unit 7"
   - Do NOT consolidate multiple units to building level
   - Keep address formatting as it appears in source

2. MULTIPLE PCAs AT SAME ADDRESS:
   - Create SEPARATE rows for each PCA at an address
   - Example: If "675 Progress Avenue" has Metal Treatment (#33) AND Vehicles Manufacturing (#57), create 2 rows
   - If facility has plating AND machine shop → 2 rows (PCA #33 and #34)
   - If UST removed with backfill → 2 rows (PCA #28 for tank, #30 for fill material)

3. PCA TYPE CLASSIFICATION:
   - Match activities to official PCA list (1-59) when possible
   - Look for keywords: "plating" → #33, "waste oils" → #28, "printing" → #31, etc.
   - For activities not in official list, use pca_number: null and describe in pca_name

4. NON-STANDARD PCAs (IMPORTANT - often missed):
   - Spills/leaks (oil, gasoline, diesel, chemicals) → ALWAYS include
   - De-icing salts usage on parking lots
   - Fill material importation (backfill with unknown material)
   - Underground/aboveground storage tank (UST/AST) for fuels/chemicals
   - PCB storage sites (drums, transformers with PCBs)
   Include these even if not in official numbered list (set pca_number to null)

5. HISTORICAL OPERATIONS (Very Strict):
   - ONLY extract City Directory if entry includes EXPLICIT industrial descriptor
   - Good: "Malpack Polybag Co Ltd - plastic bag manufacturer"
   - Good: "Gaya Industries Ltd - plating shop"  
   - Good: "Hang Tough Products - plastic extrusion shop"
   - Bad: "ABC Company Ltd" (no descriptor)
   - Bad: "XYZ Services" (service, not manufacturing)
   - Bad: "123 Corporation" (just company name)
   
   REQUIRE: Manufacturing verb (manufacturer, fabrication, plating, extrusion, processing)
   OR: Shop type (plating shop, machine shop, printing shop)
   OR: ERIS waste generator record with industrial operation SIC code

6. LOCATION CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL):
   location_relation_to_site field MUST be EXACTLY one of these two values:
   - "On-Site" = if PCA is at the subject property addresses (670-690 Progress Avenue)
   - "Off-Site" = if PCA is at ANY other address (neighboring, adjacent, nearby properties)
   
   For distance/direction information (e.g., "30 m south", "ENE/30.5", "East Adjacent"):
   - Put this in the description_timeline field
   - Example: "A.G. Simpson Co, metal stamping (1947-), located 20m south of site"

7. DESCRIPTION COMPLETENESS:
   - Include business/company names performing industrial operations
   - Include operation types and SIC codes for manufacturing/industrial
   - Include timeline/dates (e.g., "1986-1998", "1991 to 2000")
   - Include waste types that indicate industrial processes (solvents, heavy metals, etc.)
   - If Off-Site, include distance/direction (e.g., "30 m south", "adjacent east")
