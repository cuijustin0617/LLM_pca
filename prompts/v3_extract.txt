Extract Potentially Contaminating Activities (PCAs) from the ERIS environmental report text.

## Task
Identify WELL-DOCUMENTED PCAs with clear evidence. Be SELECTIVE - only extract PCAs that have concrete evidence in the report.

## CRITICAL: Quality over Quantity
- Extract ONLY PCAs with clear, documented evidence
- Skip vague mentions, speculation, or generic references
- Each PCA must have: specific address + identifiable activity + some supporting detail
- When in doubt, DO NOT extract

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

## EXTRACT (High Confidence)
✓ Primary industrial operations at a facility (plating shop, machine shop, dry cleaner, auto garage)
✓ Documented storage tanks (UST/AST) with specific details
✓ Recorded spills or contamination events
✓ Manufacturing/processing facilities with clear evidence
✓ Facilities with documented hazardous waste generation tied to industrial activity

## DO NOT EXTRACT (Low Confidence)
✗ Generic "waste generator" listings without clear industrial activity
✗ Property management, office buildings, retail stores
✗ Medical/dental offices (unless hospital-scale)
✗ Distribution/wholesale without manufacturing
✗ Vague historical mentions without specifics
✗ Off-site locations >200m away (unless major contamination source)
✗ Support services (cleaning, security, consulting)

## Examples (All from ERIS reports)

### Example 1: Gas Station with USTs (EXTRACT - documented tanks)
```json
{
  "address": "1467 Bathurst Street",
  "location_relation_to_site": "Off-Site",
  "pca_number": 28,
  "pca_name": "Gasoline and Associated Products Storage in Fixed Tanks",
  "description_timeline": "60 m east. Gas Station with 5 gasoline USTs (2007), 10 USTs (2008). Waste generator of waste oils 2002-2019.",
  "source_pages": "ERIS"
}
```

### Example 2: Dry Cleaner with Halogenated Solvents (EXTRACT - clear industrial activity)
```json
{
  "address": "521 St. Clair Avenue West",
  "location_relation_to_site": "Off-Site",
  "pca_number": 37,
  "pca_name": "Operation of Dry Cleaning Equipment (where chemicals are used)",
  "description_timeline": "75 m south. Sketchley Cleaners, Embassy Cleaners Inc. Waste generator of halogenated solvents 1986-1998.",
  "source_pages": "ERIS"
}
```

### Example 3: Metal Treatment/Plating (EXTRACT - industrial manufacturing)
```json
{
  "address": "109-111 Vaughan Road",
  "location_relation_to_site": "Off-Site",
  "pca_number": 33,
  "pca_name": "Metal Treatment, Coating, Plating and Finishing",
  "description_timeline": "90 m northwest. Amberhue Enterprises, jewellery and silverware manufacturing (1955).",
  "source_pages": "ERIS"
}
```

### Example 4: Historic Fuel Oil Tank (EXTRACT - documented tank)
```json
{
  "address": "1515 Bathurst Street",
  "location_relation_to_site": "Off-Site",
  "pca_number": 28,
  "pca_name": "Gasoline and Associated Products Storage in Fixed Tanks",
  "description_timeline": "65 m northeast. St. Michaels College. 500-gallon fuel oil UST (1950).",
  "source_pages": "ERIS"
}
```

### Example 5: Generic Waste Generator (DO NOT EXTRACT)
Input: "ABC Property Management - waste generator of paint residues"
→ Skip: No industrial operation, just property maintenance waste.

### Example 6: Office Building (DO NOT EXTRACT)
Input: "Professional offices - waste generator of photoprocessing waste"
→ Skip: Routine office waste, not industrial activity.

## Guidelines
1. Create separate rows for each (Address + PCA) combination
2. location_relation_to_site: Use ONLY "On-Site" or "Off-Site"
3. Put distance/direction in description_timeline for off-site entries
4. Prefer fewer, high-quality extractions over many uncertain ones
